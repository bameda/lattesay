lattesay is a configurable talking cow, based on cowsay originall
written in Perl by [Tony Monroe](http://www.nog.net/~tony/).

This project is a translation in JavaScript of the original
program and an attempt to bring the same silliness to node.js
by [Fabio Crisci][https://github.com/piuccio].

It has now been rewritten in coffee and added some improvements.

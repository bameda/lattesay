lattesay
========

lattesay is a configurable talking cow written in CoffeeScript, based on cowsay originall written in Perl by
`Tony Monroe <http://www.nog.net/~tony/>`_.

This project is a translation in JavaScript of the original program and an attempt to bring the same silliness 
to node.js by `Fabio Crisci <https://github.com/piuccio>`_.

It has now been rewritten in coffee and added some improvements.
